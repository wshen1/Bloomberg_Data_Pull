Hong Kong Positions Itself as Global Hub as 90% of Family Offices Integrate ESG,"['Professional Daily Newsletter', 'Help us improve your experience, delivering more of what you want', 'The latest survey from the Sustainable Finance Initiative (SFI) indicates a profound shift in global capital allocation, with 90% of family offices now committing funds to environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments. The findings position Hong Kong at the crossroads of private wealth management and impact investing, reinforcing its growing appeal as a financial hub for sustainable capital.', 'Of the 144 family offices across 15 countries surveyed during SFI’s annual Impact Summit, nearly 20% reported that ESG-linked assets make up at least half of their portfolios. Close to 60% said they had committed 10% or more of their holdings to sustainable investments.', '“These results show real and genuine commitment to sustainable investment,” saidKaty Yung, chief executive of SFI. “Family offices have not only maintained their focus but refined their strategies to capture both social impact and robust returns.”', 'Hong Kong’s ambitions to strengthen its position as a global family office hub are converging with a growing appetite for ESG allocations. Government support has been explicit: the administration has rolled out tax concessions, streamlined regulatory pathways, and championed sustainable finance in official policy.', 'Tom Chan Pak-lam, permanent honourable president of the Institute of Securities Dealers,noted that the regulatory requirement for all Hong Kong-listed companies to disclose ESG policies has created a more transparent environment for impact investing.“The Hong Kong government has been promoting both family offices and sustainable investments in the city in recent years,” he said. “Disclosure rules make it easier for family offices to identify and assess potential ESG targets.”', 'That alignment comes at a time of strong equity performance. The Hang Seng Index has climbed nearly 30% this year, building on an 18% gain last year, and the city has reclaimed its title as the world’s largest IPO market in the first eight months of 2025. For family offices, the depth of the capital market offers a ready platform to support fundraising for ESG projects.', 'The survey revealed a notable pivot in priorities. Nature-based solutions such as reforestation, wetland restoration, and regenerative agriculture were ranked as the leading area for family office investment. Food and agriculture, the top pick in 2024, dropped to second place, followed by healthcare.', '“The data suggests that while food security and health remain vital, capital owners are increasingly realising the power of natural regeneration—not only in securing long-term societal benefits, but also as a cost-effective and accessible climate solution,” theSFI reportsaid.', 'Two-thirds of respondents said they were on track to meet their sustainable investment goals this year, though 37% acknowledged they expected to fall short.', 'RELATED ARTICLE:Hong Kong SAR Launches $767 Million Digital Green Bonds', 'Asia-Pacific emerged as the leading region for sustainable allocations, with 42% of respondents citing it as their top investment market. Africa followed with 16%, while Europe and North America each accounted for 15%. Latin America and the Middle East trailed with 6% and 5% respectively.', 'In terms of financial instruments, family offices leaned toward alternative strategies: 25% opted for private equity, 22% for direct investments, and the remainder through grants and loans. The mix reflects both the flexibility and risk appetite of family offices, which often seek greater control and influence over impact outcomes than institutional investors.', 'The growing role of family offices in directing capital toward sustainable priorities highlights a wider governance trend. As private wealth becomes an increasingly significant driver of capital markets, its alignment with global climate goals could accelerate the financing of low-carbon transitions, particularly in Asia and emerging markets.', 'For executives and investors, the findings underline two dynamics: the policy environment in Hong Kong is making the city a magnet for ESG-related wealth, and family offices globally are moving from exploratory allocations to more structured, high-conviction strategies.', '“From last year’s early signals to this year’s robust and refined data, our findings highlight the dynamism and determination of family offices in Asia-Pacific,” Yung said.', 'As sustainability frameworks continue to evolve, Hong Kong’s ability to marry capital market depth with a transparent ESG disclosure regime is likely to be a key determinant of whether the city consolidates its role as a global hub for impact investment.', 'FollowESG News on LinkedIn', 'First Name', '', 'Last Name', 'Email address:', '', 'Official logo of ESG News (C) 2025', 'About Us', 'Become a Contributor', 'Newsletter', 'Contact Us', 'Climate Week NYC 2025', 'Advertise With Us', 'Promote An Event', 'News Agency', 'Terms & Conditions', 'Privacy Policy', 'Cookies', 'Copyright']",https://esgnews.com/

"Denmark to Launch EU-Standard Green Bonds, Raising the Bar for Sovereign Issuance","['Professional Daily Newsletter', 'Help us improve your experience, delivering more of what you want', 'Denmark is preparing to enter capital markets with what would be the world’s first sovereign bonds issued under the EU Green Bond Standard (EUGBS), a regulatory framework designed to bring greater transparency and integrity to sustainable finance.', 'The bonds will be issued on the basis of a newly developed framework, or “Factsheet,” which has been reviewed by Sustainable Fitch and validated as compliant with both the EU Taxonomy and the widely used Green Bond Principles of the International Capital Market Association (ICMA).', 'SEB, the Nordic bank that has advised on some of Europe’s largest green issuances, supported Danish authorities in shaping the framework.', 'While several European states have issued sovereign green bonds since 2017, Denmark’s adoption of the EU’s standard marks a turning point. The EUGBS, introduced in late 2023, goes beyond voluntary principles by requiring full Taxonomy alignment of eligible expenditures.', 'That means proceeds from Denmark’s upcoming bonds can only finance activities that meet the EU’s rigorous criteria for climate and environmental sustainability. Eligible categories include subsidies for solar and wind generation, investments in electricity transmission infrastructure, electrification of the national railway, and afforestation and wetland restoration projects that sequester carbon dioxide while boosting biodiversity.', '“This approach shows how sovereigns can demonstrate leadership in mobilising capital for a sustainable future,” saidLars Eibeholm, SEB’s Global Head of Sustainable Debt Capital Markets.He added that Denmark’s move could shift market practice by embedding higher-quality issuance standards among sovereign borrowers.', 'By aligning fully with the EU Taxonomy, Denmark positions itself as a policy leader within the EU’s climate agenda. Unlike other frameworks that allow partial alignment or broader interpretations, the Danish Factsheet requires that 100% of expenditures financed meet Taxonomy thresholds.', 'Sustainable Fitch confirmed that the framework satisfies the three core Taxonomy criteria: substantial contribution to environmental objectives, avoidance of significant harm to other objectives, and adherence to minimum social safeguards.', 'For investors and policymakers, this alignment provides greater certainty about environmental integrity. It also helps mitigate concerns about “greenwashing” that have increasingly drawn scrutiny from regulators and civil society groups.', 'The decision comes as Denmark continues to accelerate its energy transition. The country already generates more than half of its electricity from wind power and is investing heavily in offshore capacity, power interconnectors, and renewable hydrogen. Financing through EU-standard green bonds is expected to support these projects while diversifying Denmark’s sovereign funding instruments.', 'The inclusion of nature-based solutions, such as wetlands restoration, is also significant. It places Denmark among the few sovereigns explicitly linking biodiversity with bond-financed expenditures, reflecting the EU’s broader push to embed “nature-positive” finance into its regulatory frameworks.', 'The global green bond market surpassed $2 trillion in cumulative issuance in 2023, but sovereign participation remains relatively modest compared to corporates and multilateral institutions. Denmark’s move could spur peers to adopt the EU standard, especially in the euro area where investor appetite for high-integrity green instruments continues to grow.', 'By setting stricter eligibility rules, Denmark may also influence pricing dynamics. Analysts note that sovereign green bonds typically achieve a “greenium” — slightly lower yields compared with conventional bonds — due to strong demand from ESG-focused investors. A bond tied explicitly to EU Taxonomy-aligned projects may further strengthen that pricing effect, while reinforcing Denmark’s reputation for fiscal prudence and climate leadership.', 'RELATED ARTICLE:Deloitte Denmark Aids Carlsberg Group in Navigating New ESG Legislation', 'For corporate issuers, Denmark’s approach offers a preview of how the EUGBS might eventually reshape expectations in sustainable finance markets. Multinationals operating in Europe could face growing investor pressure to ensure their green financing structures are consistent with Taxonomy rules.', 'For investors, the bonds provide an early opportunity to allocate capital with greater assurance of environmental integrity, though monitoring and reporting standards will be tested once funds are deployed.', 'Finally, for policymakers and regulators, Denmark’s issuance will serve as a case study for how sovereign frameworks can align with EU sustainability objectives while maintaining investor appeal. If successful, it could accelerate uptake of the EUGBS across Europe and beyond.', 'Denmark’s entry into the EUGBS regime comes as governments worldwide grapple with how to direct capital into climate-aligned infrastructure without eroding market confidence. By setting a precedent for sovereign borrowers, Copenhagen is effectively testing whether regulatory rigor can coexist with market flexibility.', 'The outcome will resonate beyond Europe. Countries considering sovereign green issuance — from Canada to emerging markets in Asia and Latin America — will be watching how Denmark balances transparency, demand, and pricing.', 'If successful, the issuance could expand the role of sovereign bonds as a credible tool to finance the transition, influencing global standards at a time when the credibility of green finance is under heightened scrutiny.', 'FollowESG News on LinkedIn', 'First Name', '', 'Last Name', 'Email address:', '', 'Official logo of ESG News (C) 2025', 'About Us', 'Become a Contributor', 'Newsletter', 'Contact Us', 'Climate Week NYC 2025', 'Advertise With Us', 'Promote An Event', 'News Agency', 'Terms & Conditions', 'Privacy Policy', 'Cookies', 'Copyright']",https://esgnews.com/
Poland to Launch First Direct Air Capture Facility in Kielce,"['Professional Daily Newsletter', 'Help us improve your experience, delivering more of what you want', 'Kielce, a city in southeastern Poland, is preparing to host the country’s first direct air capture (DAC) installation, a pilot facility designed to remove carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere. The project, a collaboration between the Kielce municipal government and Warsaw-based technology firm Oraquel S.A., is framed as both an environmental initiative and a public education effort.', 'Once operational, the solar-powered system will be capable of extracting 500 tons of CO2 annually, equivalent to offsetting emissions from about 70 households that still rely on coal stoves. Developers say the captured volumes could also be compared to emissions from a diesel car driven 2.5 million kilometers.', 'The Kielce municipality has positioned the project as part of the city’s climate adaptation strategy, where technology and community engagement converge. Mayor Agata Wojda described the facility as more than a carbon removal unit. “By showing the effectiveness of the new technology, we can teach about the adaptation of cities to environmental and climate change and about what we can all do on our own to make Kielce continue to be a green and friendly city,” she said.', 'Her comments reflect Poland’s broader balancing act. The country remains heavily reliant on coal in its energy mix, yet faces binding EU climate obligations and increasing scrutiny under Brussels’ decarbonization policies. Pilot-scale projects such as this are seen as testing grounds for integrating advanced climate technologies into local governance structures.', 'Oraquel S.A. will provide the hardware and technical expertise. The firm, led by CEO Wojciech Mudyna, specializes in modular DAC units and has positioned itself as a contender in Europe’s emerging carbon removal sector. The Kielce system will employ patented filters that capture CO2 and can be replaced to maintain efficiency.', 'Mudyna highlighted the practical benefits of Oraquel’s technology, noting that the captured carbon is stable and can be transported or stored with relative ease. While details of financing have not been disclosed, the project has been structured to allow scalability, with discussions already underway for deploying additional units across Poland.', 'For investors and technology developers, the pilot offers insight into how small-scale DAC systems can be integrated into municipal sustainability plans. It also creates potential entry points for private capital as the EU Carbon Removal Certification Framework takes shape and compliance demand builds.', 'RELATED ARTICLE:Heirloom Secures $150M Series B to Scale Direct Air Capture Technology', 'What distinguishes the Kielce project is its explicit educational mandate. Beyond technical demonstration, the installation is intended to serve as a public learning hub. Local officials expect the site to engage residents in conversations about energy efficiency, emissions reduction, and city-level resilience planning.', 'In a region where coal remains politically and culturally entrenched, the project carries symbolic weight. It shows how municipalities can adopt new technologies without waiting for large-scale national programs to mature.', 'For executives, investors, and policymakers, the Kielce initiative signals three key dynamics. First, DAC technologies are no longer confined to global players in North America or the Nordics; they are moving into Central and Eastern Europe under municipal leadership. Second, the integration of renewables into DAC design offers a template for ensuring carbon removal projects do not themselves generate additional emissions. Third, education and public engagement are being treated as integral components of deployment — a trend likely to gain traction as governments seek societal buy-in for energy transition measures.', 'As the EU presses ahead with climate neutrality targets for 2050, Poland’s experiment in Kielce illustrates how decentralized action can complement national and bloc-wide strategies. While the captured volume is modest relative to national emissions, the initiative positions Poland within the fast-evolving carbon removal conversation.', 'For Europe’s climate finance and technology ecosystem, it is a reminder that emerging markets within the EU are beginning to explore frontier solutions. The Kielce pilot may be a small step, but it reflects a shift toward broader geographic participation in carbon removal — and signals potential new opportunities for capital, partnerships, and technology transfer across the continent.', 'FollowESG News on LinkedIn', 'First Name', '', 'Last Name', 'Email address:', '', 'Official logo of ESG News (C) 2025', 'About Us', 'Become a Contributor', 'Newsletter', 'Contact Us', 'Climate Week NYC 2025', 'Advertise With Us', 'Promote An Event', 'News Agency', 'Terms & Conditions', 'Privacy Policy', 'Cookies', 'Copyright']",https://esgnews.com/

For perspective, Google needed more than a decade to hit that figure. Such scale sparks unease: are we pouring too much energy and water into a digital convenience?', 'History offers perspective. Vaccines once demanded vast R&D budgets but transformed public health. Synthetic fertilisers consumed energy on a colossal scale, yet they underpinned half the world’s food supply. The same logic applies to AI: the way we design and scale it will determine whether it becomes a climate burden—or a solution.', 'Concerns about energy are not misplaced. In 2023, data centres powering AI consumed as much energy as entire countries like Germany or France. Yet when broken down, a single ChatGPT-4o reply uses about 0.3 watt-hours—the energy needed to keep a lightbulb glowing for five minutes. To match the emissions of a New York–London flight, you’d need hundreds of thousands of prompts. Even AI’s much-debated water use is modest against everyday benchmarks: tens of thousands of interactions equal the water it takes to make one pair of jeans.', 'That doesn’t diminish the bigger picture. Aggregate use adds up. Left unchecked, the sector risks embedding a new layer of demand on already strained grids. But technology also carries its own remedy. AI is proving adept at trimming inefficiencies from the systems that matter most: light industry could cut energy use by 8% by 2035 with AI’s optimisation, while transport may see a 20% drop. In the lab, AI is doubling the pace of material discovery, nudging us towards breakthroughs in batteries and clean technologies.', 'RELATED ARTICLE:Aalo Atomics Closes $100M to Accelerate Modular Nuclear Plants for AI Data Centers', '“We need to stop thinking of AI as a rogue actor and start recognising it as part of the broader climate and energy system,” says theBezos Earth Fund, which is investing in systemic upgrades.

Guest Post: ESG Is Under Fire – Here’s How We Can Rebuild Trust,"['Professional Daily Newsletter', 'Help us improve your experience, delivering more of what you want', '', 'By Jeff Hallstead, Sustainability, ESG & Social Impact Brand Manager', 'The acronym “ESG” has become a lightning rod in the U.S. debate over responsible investing. In recent years, several states have withdrawn investments from ESG-focused funds amid accusations of “woke capitalism.” Florida’s treasury, for example, pulled $2 billion from BlackRock in late 2022 – the largest anti-ESG divestment to date – with Texas soon after following, and since, a number of U.S. states are now pushing back on sustainability requirements.', 'As someone who has long championed sustainable investing, I recognize the frustration. But it’s important to note that skepticism toward ESG hasn’t come from nowhere – in my opinion, it reflects concerns about accuracy in reporting that are causing credibility concerns industry-wide.', 'Critics lean to flawed frameworks as the primary driver of ESG issues, citing inconsistent, unfair ratings for major polluters who have strong S that outweighs environmentally friendly companies with strong “E’s” that some say are inappropriate rating scews.', 'But the data isn’t all against ESG, only about 5-10% of investor sentiments is negative about ESG, and according to available GROK andsurveys also show that about one-third of investors are totally satisfied with the quality of corporate ESG reporting, 50% are neutral. The vast majority of negative investor and global sentiment surrounding ESG is frustration of lack of progress making up about 80-90% of negative sentiment across social chatter.\xa0 This highlights a clear demand: reliable data and verifiable impact.', 'The good news is that technology and innovation, much of it already at our fingertips, can address the trust gaps – taking the human elements and PR spin out of the equation.', 'We now have the tools to collect ESG data straight from the source – automatically and continuously. For example, satellites and remote sensors can directly measure a factory’s emissions or monitor deforestation in a supply chain. In fact, a new generation of private satellite firms is doing exactly this,tracking greenhouse gas emissions down to individual facilities and spotting forest loss in real time.', 'This is the sustainability equivalent of installing a financial audit system that runs 24/7. This kind of automation not only improves accuracy; it also deters greenwashing.', 'This is where blockchain technology comes in. By recording ESG metrics on a distributed, spin-proof ledger, we create animmutable audit trail that all stakeholders can inspect.In practice, this could mean each ton of CO₂ reduced, each megawatt of renewable energy generated, each community project funded is logged as a digital entry is concete and autiable by anyone.\xa0 Blockchain “smart contracts” can even automate accountability: for instance, releasing funds or carbon credits only when a project’s data confirms that atarget has been met.', 'Such efforts are taking place. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and Hong Kong Monetary Authority piloted a tokenized green bond that uses blockchain, IoT sensors, and smart contracts to track environmental outcomes in real time, ensuring the solar farms financed by the bond actually produce the promised clean energy. This and other examples hint at a future where ESG initiatives are transparent and accountable.', 'The current backlash has been a pendulum swing of momentum – almost like a market correction. Right now, ESG needs to evolve if it is to fulfill its intended purpose for humanity and our next generation of business practices. The only way forward is to fundamentally upgrade the plumbing behind the promises. That means companies and the ESG industry must invest in the boring stuff: next generation data architecture, verification protocols, independent audits – in a nutshell, the\xa0 technology platforms that deliver transparency at scale.', 'If we do this right, the payoff will be a resurgence of credibility. Imagine annual sustainability reports that investorstrust, backed by the quantitative, immutable data. Imagine not having to take a company’s word for it when it says it’s “net-zero,” because anyone can check a public dashboard of its emissions and offsets. Rebuilding that kind of trust is entirely possible. It’s already happening in pockets, as noted above, through innovations by forward-looking regulators and firms. We need to mainstream it.', 'Rather than seeing this as a setback, we can recognize it as an opportunity to strengthen the foundations of ESG. The solution is not to abandon responsible investing but to improve how we measure, verify and communicate impact. In other words: less marketing spin, more trustworthy mechanics.', 'Technology can play a key role here. Today we have the ability to collect ESG data directly from the source, automatically and continuously. Satellites and remote sensors, for instance, can monitor a factory’s emissions or track deforestation in a supply chain. Several firms already use this approach, pinpointing greenhouse gas emissions at the facility level and spotting forest loss in real time. This is essentially the sustainability equivalent of a continuous audit system.', 'Blockchain technology adds another layer of accountability. By recording ESG metrics on distributed ledgers, we can create transparent audit trails that cannot be tampered with. Smart contracts even allow for automated accountability – for example, releasing carbon credits only when emissions data confirms that reductions have been achieved. The Bank for International Settlements and Hong Kong Monetary Authority recently piloted a tokenized green bond using blockchain, IoT sensors, and smart contracts to ensure that financed solar farms delivered the promised clean energy. These innovations show what is possible.', 'The ESG brand has faced reputational challenges, but this moment provides a chance to reframe its role with clarity and accountability. Companies and the broader ESG ecosystem must now focus on strengthening data architecture, verification protocols, independent audits, and scalable technology platforms.

India’s Data Centre Industry: Powering Growth Sustainably?,"['Professional Daily Newsletter', 'Help us improve your experience, delivering more of what you want', '', 'Industry Research by: EsgCiti Research Team led by Ms. Madhu Jha, Director & COO, EsgCiti Green Pvt. Ltd.', 'India is progressing on a digital trajectory, and at the core of this transition lies the data centre industry. Over the past decade, this sector has attracted investments estimated at US$6.5 billion (IEEFA 2024). By July 2025, India has 153 data centres, with a collective capacity of 1,263 MW, primarily located in five key metropolitan areas: Mumbai (61), Hyderabad (33), Delhi NCR (31), Bangalore (31), and Chennai (30).', 'By 2026, India’s data center capacity is projected to increase by 66%, adding an estimated 604 MW in two years to reach a total of 1,521 MW (india-briefing.com2024). This digital infrastructure is expected to double its current footprint, expanding from 1.15 GW in 2024 to 2.1 GW by 2027, a substantial expansion requiring an investment of ₹40,000-45,000 crore (ICRA 2024). Mumbai, contributing 35% of this national growth, indicates its evolving role as a digital hub in Asia (Yahoo Finance 2024).', 'As India pursues this digitally-focused future, it faces an important decision regarding its development path. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has recognized this, renewing discussions on the National Data Centre Policy, a framework initially proposed in 2020. This policy, along with measures such as simplifying approvals, providing single-window permissions, encouraging domestic manufacturing, and offering incentives, are relevant for supporting the industry’s expansion.', 'However, realizing the full promise of this digital development extends beyond merely laying more fiber optics or installing additional server racks. It necessitates a more comprehensive approach: a firm commitment from the government, policymakers, and all related sectors to integrate sustainability and environmental considerations into every operational decision.', 'Preserving Resources To Power Growth', 'The rapid expansion of the data centre industry presents considerable environmental challenges, particularly concerning its energy and water demands. These large facilities are notably energy and water-intensive. Projections indicate they will consume 3% of India’s electricity by 2030, a substantial increase from less than 1% today. This surge is partly driven by the growing requirements of AI workloads, with cloud providers having already pre-booked 800 MW of power for this infrastructure (IEEFA 2024; JLL 2024). A single AI chip can demand between 300-700W, meaning a cluster of 10,000 units can require over 7 MW,\xa0\xa0a scale that demands careful resource planning. Furthermore, cooling this hardware is a highly water-intensive process, projected to require hundreds of billions of litres of water annually.', 'Beyond these immediate concerns, a growing dependence on energy imports could render data centres vulnerable to fluctuating pricing and increased costs, particularly amid evolving global tensions and trade dynamics. This situation could diminish the perceived stability of natural gas as an energy source. As a recent IEEFA report underscored, “Of all commodities, liquefied natural gas (LNG) is most sensitive to geopolitical disturbances, with conflict magnifying the market’s inherent volatility” (IEEFA 2024).', 'Managing the Grid', 'Technological advancements offer a further potent mechanism for progress. Data centre designers, for example, typically evaluate air and evaporative cooling systems based on specific local conditions, assessing climate patterns, power availability, and importantly, water stress. While evaporative cooling can conserve energy in grids with limited power, it is generally renounced in water-scarce regions to preserve water availability for community needs (Equinix).', 'Innovations, including liquid cooling and AI-driven energy management, possess the capability to reduce water and electricity consumption by 30-40% (Turner & Townsend 2024). These methods confer environmental benefits and are 25-30% less costly to operate, demonstrating the alignment of sustainability with profitability (Deloitte 2024). Contemporary facilities frequently achieve an efficient Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) of 1.3-1.5, indicative of effective energy management. Moreover, implementing AI-driven energy management systems can optimize operations in real-time, thereby minimizing waste and anticipating maintenance requirements before they escalate and affect the local communities.', 'RELATED ARTICLE:India Unveils Draft Climate Finance Taxonomy to Boost Green Capital Flows', 'Policy and Principles', 'The transition to a sustainable data centre ecosystem simply cannot materialize in a vacuum. The Indian government has already made a big move by granting the sector ‘infrastructure status.’ This designation streamlines access to long-term capital, underscoring the sector’s pivotal role in national economic development. Moreover, state-level policies provide additional impetus through incentives for integrating environmentally conscious technologies. The government’s Viability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme may also cover up to 30% of capital expenditure for standalone Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) projects (IEEFA 2024).', 'Beyond regulatory frameworks, a noticeable move towards Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles is emerging within India’s large and medium sized businesses. Environmentally sound data centres frequently exhibit 25-30% reduced operating costs due to enhanced energy efficiency, fostering their resilience and sustained profitability (Data Center Dynamics 2024). This adherence to ESG also involves greater transparency regarding water consumption in their disclosures, as stakeholders increasingly require insight into resource stewardship by these entities. By embracing circular economy principles for e-waste management, this new industry can increasingly align its growth with an expanded understanding of corporate accountability.', 'Charting a Sustainable Digital Future', 'The India Data Centre Industry is now valued at an estimated $10 billion, yielding a substantial $1.2 billion in revenue in the recent financial year (2023-24) (Anarock). This represents a notable contribution to the national economy. India’s data centre development presents a considerable prospect to serve as a global model, provided sustainability remains central to its trajectory. This ambition calls for a three-pronged strategy. First, a deliberate and accelerated transition to renewable energy sources is essential, leveraging India’s significant solar and wind potential to power this digital expansion. Second, the widespread adoption of advanced, water and energy-efficient technologies becomes imperative, ensuring that growth does not disproportionately strain vital natural resources. Finally, establishing a supportive and transparent regulatory ecosystem that consistently incentivizes green practices and fosters accountability across the industry is fundamental.', 'By integrating these core elements, India can not only secure its digital future but also present a demonstrable approach for responsible data centre industrial growth that is replicable for other developing economies.', 'FollowESG News on LinkedIn', 'First Name', '', 'Last Name', 'Email address:', '', 'Official logo of ESG News (C) 2025', 'About Us', 'Become a Contributor', 'Newsletter', 'Contact Us', 'Climate Week NYC 2025', 'Advertise With Us', 'Promote An Event', 'News Agency', 'Terms & Conditions', 'Privacy Policy', 'Cookies', 'Copyright']",https://esgnews.com/

The “Let Green Gas Count” coalition, launched in February 2025 and led by the American Biogas Council (ABC) and the World Biogas Association (WBA), released a set of recommendations urging recognition of market instruments for biogas and renewable natural gas (RNG) in corporate greenhouse gas inventories.', 'At issue is how Scope 1 emissions — direct emissions from owned or controlled sources — can be reported when companies replace conventional natural gas with certified renewable alternatives. The coalition argues that without interim clarity, corporate decarbonization strategies will remain constrained, and capital for new projects will be delayed.', 'The GHG Protocol is currently undergoing a multi-year update, with new guidance expected in 2028. Until then, companies lack clear rules on how to account for the purchase and use of green gases. The coalition’s proposal seeks to fill that gap by allowing the use of certified instruments, such as green gas certificates, in emissions reporting.', 'Patrick Serfass, executive director of the ABC, said the absence of recognition has become a barrier to market growth.“Biogas, and renewable natural gas made from biogas, are two of the lowest carbon intensity energy sources available. But investment in projects that produce these fuels is currently thwarted by the lack of clear guidance on market instruments that recognize their carbon intensity,” he said. The recommendations, he added, would “unlock new investment, accelerate project development, and ensure renewable natural gas and biogas can be recognized for their full, science-based climate benefits.”', 'For producers, the lack of explicit GHG Protocol guidance is more than an accounting gap. It has slowed the growth of a sector that turns organic waste into energy, prevents methane emissions, and offers a route to decarbonize heavy industry, transport, and other hard-to-abate sectors.', 'Charlotte Morton OBE, chief executive of the WBA, said: “The GHG Protocol’s lack of guidance on the use of market instruments has significantly slowed the growth of the biomethane industry, which prevents particularly harmful methane emissions from organic wastes and is one of the few options for decarbonising hard-to-decarbonise sectors.

"Singapore Launches First National Plastic Passport, Opening Path to ASEAN’s $4.2B Circular Economy","['Professional Daily Newsletter', 'Help us improve your experience, delivering more of what you want', 'The city-state has become the first government worldwide to roll out a national plastic passport program, powered by Nasdaq-listed SMX technology and its research partner A*STAR. The initiative moves beyond pilot projects and brand commitments, embedding molecular markers directly into plastics to create a verified digital identity for every item produced, used, and recycled.', 'Officials frame the effort not as a recycling boost, but as a structural shift in how plastics are valued. Instead of waste destined for landfills or incinerators, every polymer—from PET bottles to automotive resins—can now carry proof of origin and reuse potential. This infrastructure is designed to create transparency, reduce leakage, and generate economic value from materials long treated as disposable.', 'The stakes are regional. ASEAN economies produce millions of tonnes of plastic waste each year, much of which is lost to waterways and unmanaged dumps. Analysts estimate the bloc’s plastics ecosystem could represent a $4.2 billion annual market if recovery systems were verifiable and scalable. Today, fragmented collection and limited reporting leave that value unrealized.', 'Singapore’s framework offers a ready-made template for its neighbors. With an integrated economic community and rising environmental priorities, ASEAN has the political and commercial incentives to replicate the model. The move aligns with broader trade dynamics, where multinationals face rising pressure to substantiate recycled content claims across global supply chains.', 'SMX, known for creating physical-to-digital tracking systems in industries ranging from natural rubber to mining, sits at the center of the new regime. Its markers, invisible at the molecular level, can survive production and recycling processes, linking plastics to a secure digital passport.', 'By anchoring Singapore’s initiative, SMX has moved from technology supplier to policy enabler. If adopted regionally, its system could become ASEAN’s default infrastructure for plastics traceability. That outcome would give regulators a cross-border compliance tool, brands a defensible way to prove circularity claims, and governments a method to convert waste into taxable, tradable economic assets.', 'The program introduces a new asset class through SMX’s Plastic Cycle Token, which allows recycled value to be measured and traded. For investors, this creates potential liquidity in a sector previously defined by waste management costs rather than revenue streams.', 'For policy leaders, Singapore’s model reduces reliance on voluntary corporate reporting by embedding traceability into the material itself. It provides a practical mechanism to enforce environmental regulation and align with global frameworks such as the EU’s push for stricter reporting on recycled content.', 'RELATED ARTICLE:Pigeon Singapore and LyondellBasell Partner to Introduce Bio-Circular Plastic in Nursing Bottles', 'For ASEAN, the question is not whether the technology works—the Singapore rollout demonstrates that it does—but how quickly it can scale. A regional standard would require coordination among governments, industry players, and trade bodies. Yet the rewards are significant: reduced marine pollution, economic capture of lost material value, and stronger positioning in global sustainable trade.', 'For SMX, scaling from Singapore to ASEAN would shift its business model toward operating at the level of regional infrastructure. The parallels to early leaders in carbon markets and ESG assurance technology are clear: first-movers often define the standard and retain market power.', 'While framed as a national initiative, Singapore’s plastic passport has implications far beyond Southeast Asia. If ASEAN countries align, the bloc could set a precedent for how emerging economies address plastic waste while monetizing circular flows.

Government support has been explicit: the administration has rolled out tax concessions, streamlined regulatory pathways, and championed sustainable finance in official policy.', 'Tom Chan Pak-lam, permanent honourable president of the Institute of Securities Dealers,noted that the regulatory requirement for all Hong Kong-listed companies to disclose ESG policies has created a more transparent environment for impact investing.“The Hong Kong government has been promoting both family offices and sustainable investments in the city in recent years,” he said. “Disclosure rules make it easier for family offices to identify and assess potential ESG targets.”', 'That alignment comes at a time of strong equity performance. The Hang Seng Index has climbed nearly 30% this year, building on an 18% gain last year, and the city has reclaimed its title as the world’s largest IPO market in the first eight months of 2025. For family offices, the depth of the capital market offers a ready platform to support fundraising for ESG projects.', 'The survey revealed a notable pivot in priorities. Nature-based solutions such as reforestation, wetland restoration, and regenerative agriculture were ranked as the leading area for family office investment. Food and agriculture, the top pick in 2024, dropped to second place, followed by healthcare.', '“The data suggests that while food security and health remain vital, capital owners are increasingly realising the power of natural regeneration—not only in securing long-term societal benefits, but also as a cost-effective and accessible climate solution,” theSFI reportsaid.', 'Two-thirds of respondents said they were on track to meet their sustainable investment goals this year, though 37% acknowledged they expected to fall short.', 'RELATED ARTICLE:Hong Kong SAR Launches $767 Million Digital Green Bonds', 'Asia-Pacific emerged as the leading region for sustainable allocations, with 42% of respondents citing it as their top investment market.

The EUGBS, introduced in late 2023, goes beyond voluntary principles by requiring full Taxonomy alignment of eligible expenditures.', 'That means proceeds from Denmark’s upcoming bonds can only finance activities that meet the EU’s rigorous criteria for climate and environmental sustainability. Eligible categories include subsidies for solar and wind generation, investments in electricity transmission infrastructure, electrification of the national railway, and afforestation and wetland restoration projects that sequester carbon dioxide while boosting biodiversity.', '“This approach shows how sovereigns can demonstrate leadership in mobilising capital for a sustainable future,” saidLars Eibeholm, SEB’s Global Head of Sustainable Debt Capital Markets.He added that Denmark’s move could shift market practice by embedding higher-quality issuance standards among sovereign borrowers.', 'By aligning fully with the EU Taxonomy, Denmark positions itself as a policy leader within the EU’s climate agenda. Unlike other frameworks that allow partial alignment or broader interpretations, the Danish Factsheet requires that 100% of expenditures financed meet Taxonomy thresholds.', 'Sustainable Fitch confirmed that the framework satisfies the three core Taxonomy criteria: substantial contribution to environmental objectives, avoidance of significant harm to other objectives, and adherence to minimum social safeguards.', 'For investors and policymakers, this alignment provides greater certainty about environmental integrity. It also helps mitigate concerns about “greenwashing” that have increasingly drawn scrutiny from regulators and civil society groups.', 'The decision comes as Denmark continues to accelerate its energy transition. The country already generates more than half of its electricity from wind power and is investing heavily in offshore capacity, power interconnectors, and renewable hydrogen. Financing through EU-standard green bonds is expected to support these projects while diversifying Denmark’s sovereign funding instruments.', 'The inclusion of nature-based solutions, such as wetlands restoration, is also significant. It places Denmark among the few sovereigns explicitly linking biodiversity with bond-financed expenditures, reflecting the EU’s broader push to embed “nature-positive” finance into its regulatory frameworks.', 'The global green bond market surpassed $2 trillion in cumulative issuance in 2023, but sovereign participation remains relatively modest compared to corporates and multilateral institutions. Denmark’s move could spur peers to adopt the EU standard, especially in the euro area where investor appetite for high-integrity green instruments continues to grow.', 'By setting stricter eligibility rules, Denmark may also influence pricing dynamics. Analysts note that sovereign green bonds typically achieve a “greenium” — slightly lower yields compared with conventional bonds — due to strong demand from ESG-focused investors. A bond tied explicitly to EU Taxonomy-aligned projects may further strengthen that pricing effect, while reinforcing Denmark’s reputation for fiscal prudence and climate leadership.', 'RELATED ARTICLE:Deloitte Denmark Aids Carlsberg Group in Navigating New ESG Legislation', 'For corporate issuers, Denmark’s approach offers a preview of how the EUGBS might eventually reshape expectations in sustainable finance markets. Multinationals operating in Europe could face growing investor pressure to ensure their green financing structures are consistent with Taxonomy rules.', 'For investors, the bonds provide an early opportunity to allocate capital with greater assurance of environmental integrity, though monitoring and reporting standards will be tested once funds are deployed.', 'Finally, for policymakers and regulators, Denmark’s issuance will serve as a case study for how sovereign frameworks can align with EU sustainability objectives while maintaining investor appeal. If successful, it could accelerate uptake of the EUGBS across Europe and beyond.', 'Denmark’s entry into the EUGBS regime comes as governments worldwide grapple with how to direct capital into climate-aligned infrastructure without eroding market confidence. By setting a precedent for sovereign borrowers, Copenhagen is effectively testing whether regulatory rigor can coexist with market flexibility.', 'The outcome will resonate beyond Europe. Countries considering sovereign green issuance — from Canada to emerging markets in Asia and Latin America — will be watching how Denmark balances transparency, demand, and pricing.', 'If successful, the issuance could expand the role of sovereign bonds as a credible tool to finance the transition, influencing global standards at a time when the credibility of green finance is under heightened scrutiny.', 'FollowESG News on LinkedIn', 'First Name', '', 'Last Name', 'Email address:', '', 'Official logo of ESG News (C) 2025', 'About Us', 'Become a Contributor', 'Newsletter', 'Contact Us', 'Climate Week NYC 2025', 'Advertise With Us', 'Promote An Event', 'News Agency', 'Terms & Conditions', 'Privacy Policy', 'Cookies', 'Copyright']",https://esgnews.com/

Companies will then need to file updates every two years.', 'The guidance answers a series of questions raised by businesses since the passage of SB 261. CARB confirmed that subsidiaries are not required to prepare stand-alone reports if their parent companies disclose on their behalf. Insurance companies are also explicitly excluded from the regulation’s scope.', 'To ease compliance, CARB will allow companies to use existing reporting frameworks. These include the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation’s IFRS S2, and equivalent systems endorsed by exchanges or national governments.', 'One of the most closely watched aspects of the guidance is the decision not to require Scope 1, 2, or 3 emissions disclosures in the first reporting cycle. CARB noted that such requirements could be duplicative with SB 253, California’s separate emissions disclosure law that begins later in 2026.', 'Similarly, companies may provide qualitative rather than quantitative scenario analysis.

The Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to finalize its own climate disclosure regulations, leaving states like California to set the pace.', 'With over 5,000 companies expected to fall under SB 261, the law creates a de facto national standard given California’s economic weight. Firms outside the state but with significant California operations will be captured, pressing C-suites to integrate climate considerations more directly into governance and financial planning.', 'California’s climate disclosure package, including SB 261 and SB 253, is being watched closely by regulators worldwide. The state’s alignment with global frameworks such as TCFD and IFRS S2 positions its rules within the mainstream of international standards while also pushing the U.S. market toward greater comparability.', 'For global investors, the new law adds another layer to the patchwork of reporting requirements. Yet, it also provides greater visibility into how U.S. companies are assessing climate risks—information increasingly material to portfolio management, insurance pricing, and credit analysis.', 'As the 2026 deadline approaches, companies will need to assess governance readiness, map exposure to physical and transition risks, and prepare for eventual alignment with more demanding emissions reporting.

Coalition Presses GHG Protocol to Recognize Biogas and RNG in Corporate Emissions Reporting,"['Professional Daily Newsletter', 'Help us improve your experience, delivering more of what you want', 'A coalition of biogas and renewable gas advocates is pressing for immediate changes to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol), the world’s most widely used emissions accounting framework. The “Let Green Gas Count” coalition, launched in February 2025 and led by the American Biogas Council (ABC) and the World Biogas Association (WBA), released a set of recommendations urging recognition of market instruments for biogas and renewable natural gas (RNG) in corporate greenhouse gas inventories.', 'At issue is how Scope 1 emissions — direct emissions from owned or controlled sources — can be reported when companies replace conventional natural gas with certified renewable alternatives. The coalition argues that without interim clarity, corporate decarbonization strategies will remain constrained, and capital for new projects will be delayed.', 'The GHG Protocol is currently undergoing a multi-year update, with new guidance expected in 2028. Until then, companies lack clear rules on how to account for the purchase and use of green gases. The coalition’s proposal seeks to fill that gap by allowing the use of certified instruments, such as green gas certificates, in emissions reporting.', 'Patrick Serfass, executive director of the ABC, said the absence of recognition has become a barrier to market growth.“Biogas, and renewable natural gas made from biogas, are two of the lowest carbon intensity energy sources available. But investment in projects that produce these fuels is currently thwarted by the lack of clear guidance on market instruments that recognize their carbon intensity,” he said. The recommendations, he added, would “unlock new investment, accelerate project development, and ensure renewable natural gas and biogas can be recognized for their full, science-based climate benefits.”', 'For producers, the lack of explicit GHG Protocol guidance is more than an accounting gap. It has slowed the growth of a sector that turns organic waste into energy, prevents methane emissions, and offers a route to decarbonize heavy industry, transport, and other hard-to-abate sectors.', 'Charlotte Morton OBE, chief executive of the WBA, said: “The GHG Protocol’s lack of guidance on the use of market instruments has significantly slowed the growth of the biomethane industry, which prevents particularly harmful methane emissions from organic wastes and is one of the few options for decarbonising hard-to-decarbonise sectors. Both are critical to mitigate the current and worsening climate crisis. We mustn’t waste any more time.”', 'RELATED ARTICLE:EU Commission Publishes FAQ on Implementing New Corporate Sustainability Reporting Rules', 'For C-suite leaders and sustainability officers, the debate goes beyond technical reporting. Companies increasingly face investor scrutiny and regulatory requirements to show credible, transparent emissions reductions. Clearer treatment of renewable gases would allow corporates to demonstrate progress in decarbonization strategies, attract green finance, and avoid accusations of overstating climate gains.', 'Investors, too, are watching the outcome closely. Without assurance that biogas purchases will be counted, financing for new facilities remains risky. The coalition’s recommendations seek to de-risk that uncertainty, giving markets confidence to scale projects that could contribute to national and corporate net-zero pathways.', 'The GHG Protocol, administered by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, has long shaped the standards for climate reporting across supply chains. Pressure to modernize its rules reflects a wider shift in climate governance, where demand for precision in accounting is intensifying.', 'If the recommendations are adopted, they could provide a bridge for corporates looking to expand renewable gas use, while influencing policy debates in the U.S., Europe, and beyond.

The deal, cleared by regulators and overseen by a court-appointed administrator, includes intellectual property and a full-scale test facility in Skive, Denmark.', 'The purchase, valued in the high single-digit millions of euros and financed from existing liquidity, marks a decisive step in expanding nucera’s technology portfolio. The German company, already a leading supplier of alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), now gains access to advanced pressurized systems capable of producing hydrogen at operating pressures of up to 35 bar.', 'Hydrogen production under higher pressure is not a technical footnote. For industries such as chemicals, refining, and steelmaking—sectors central to Europe’s decarbonisation goals—compressed hydrogen is often a prerequisite. Producing it directly at pressure reduces the need for costly downstream compression, improving efficiency and lowering energy consumption.', 'By integrating GHS’s pressurized AWE solutions, thyssenkrupp nucera can address a wider set of industrial applications, positioning itself as a more versatile supplier at a time when global competition in electrolysis is intensifying.', 'The collapse of Green Hydrogen Systems had raised concerns about the stability of Europe’s hydrogen technology sector, where many firms are scaling up rapidly in an uncertain market. For thyssenkrupp nucera, the acquisition represents both consolidation and opportunity.', 'The deal ensures that years of Danish R&D are not lost, while enabling nucera to fold the technology into its broader innovation pipeline. The integration of GHS’s Skive facility provides a ready-made testbed, reducing lead times in product development.', 'Notably, the transaction required no external financing—a signal to investors that thyssenkrupp nucera maintains balance sheet flexibility while pursuing strategic acquisitions. Governance also played a central role: approvals from competition authorities and the insolvency court were prerequisites, underlining the degree of regulatory oversight in Europe’s clean-tech sector.', 'Such regulatory involvement reflects broader European priorities. The EU’s Green Deal Industrial Plan and the bloc’s emphasis on strategic autonomy in clean energy technology have put hydrogen firmly on the political and industrial agenda.

Thyssenkrupp nucera must demonstrate it can bring GHS’s technology to market at scale, while continuing to deliver on its existing project pipeline. If successful, the company could consolidate its leadership in alkaline electrolysis at a time when other technologies, such as PEM and solid oxide, are also advancing.', 'The acquisition may appear modest in financial terms, but strategically it resonates far beyond Denmark or Germany. As the global race to industrialize hydrogen accelerates, securing proven technology platforms is becoming as critical as building out electrolyser factories themselves.', 'For Europe’s industrial leaders, the message is clear: competitiveness in green hydrogen will be determined not only by scale, but by technological breadth and the ability to deploy solutions that fit the realities of heavy industry.', 'FollowESG News on LinkedIn', 'First Name', '', 'Last Name', 'Email address:', '', 'Official logo of ESG News (C) 2025', 'About Us', 'Become a Contributor', 'Newsletter', 'Contact Us', 'Climate Week NYC 2025', 'Advertise With Us', 'Promote An Event', 'News Agency', 'Terms & Conditions', 'Privacy Policy', 'Cookies', 'Copyright']",https://esgnews.com/
"Singapore Launches First National Plastic Passport, Opening Path to ASEAN’s $4.2B Circular Economy","['Professional Daily Newsletter', 'Help us improve your experience, delivering more of what you want', 'The city-state has become the first government worldwide to roll out a national plastic passport program, powered by Nasdaq-listed SMX technology and its research partner A*STAR. The initiative moves beyond pilot projects and brand commitments, embedding molecular markers directly into plastics to create a verified digital identity for every item produced, used, and recycled.', 'Officials frame the effort not as a recycling boost, but as a structural shift in how plastics are valued. Instead of waste destined for landfills or incinerators, every polymer—from PET bottles to automotive resins—can now carry proof of origin and reuse potential. This infrastructure is designed to create transparency, reduce leakage, and generate economic value from materials long treated as disposable.', 'The stakes are regional. ASEAN economies produce millions of tonnes of plastic waste each year, much of which is lost to waterways and unmanaged dumps. Analysts estimate the bloc’s plastics ecosystem could represent a $4.2 billion annual market if recovery systems were verifiable and scalable. Today, fragmented collection and limited reporting leave that value unrealized.', 'Singapore’s framework offers a ready-made template for its neighbors. With an integrated economic community and rising environmental priorities, ASEAN has the political and commercial incentives to replicate the model. The move aligns with broader trade dynamics, where multinationals face rising pressure to substantiate recycled content claims across global supply chains.', 'SMX, known for creating physical-to-digital tracking systems in industries ranging from natural rubber to mining, sits at the center of the new regime. Its markers, invisible at the molecular level, can survive production and recycling processes, linking plastics to a secure digital passport.', 'By anchoring Singapore’s initiative, SMX has moved from technology supplier to policy enabler. If adopted regionally, its system could become ASEAN’s default infrastructure for plastics traceability. That outcome would give regulators a cross-border compliance tool, brands a defensible way to prove circularity claims, and governments a method to convert waste into taxable, tradable economic assets.', 'The program introduces a new asset class through SMX’s Plastic Cycle Token, which allows recycled value to be measured and traded. For investors, this creates potential liquidity in a sector previously defined by waste management costs rather than revenue streams.', 'For policy leaders, Singapore’s model reduces reliance on voluntary corporate reporting by embedding traceability into the material itself. It provides a practical mechanism to enforce environmental regulation and align with global frameworks such as the EU’s push for stricter reporting on recycled content.', 'RELATED ARTICLE:Pigeon Singapore and LyondellBasell Partner to Introduce Bio-Circular Plastic in Nursing Bottles', 'For ASEAN, the question is not whether the technology works—the Singapore rollout demonstrates that it does—but how quickly it can scale. A regional standard would require coordination among governments, industry players, and trade bodies. Yet the rewards are significant: reduced marine pollution, economic capture of lost material value, and stronger positioning in global sustainable trade.', 'For SMX, scaling from Singapore to ASEAN would shift its business model toward operating at the level of regional infrastructure. The parallels to early leaders in carbon markets and ESG assurance technology are clear: first-movers often define the standard and retain market power.', 'While framed as a national initiative, Singapore’s plastic passport has implications far beyond Southeast Asia. If ASEAN countries align, the bloc could set a precedent for how emerging economies address plastic waste while monetizing circular flows.

Silvania Partners with Alder Point to Scale US Timberland Investments for Climate and Conservation,"['Professional Daily Newsletter', 'Help us improve your experience, delivering more of what you want', 'Silvania, the global nature capital investment platform, has entered a strategic partnership with Alder Point Capital Management to accelerate sustainable investment in US timberland and farmland. The agreement combines Silvania’s international focus on biodiversity and nature-based solutions with Alder Point’s operational expertise in ecological forestry and land management.', 'The financial commitment strengthens Alder Point’s capacity to acquire and manage climate-resilient properties while advancing conservation and regenerative agriculture initiatives. For Silvania, the move extends its model of investing alongside regional specialists to scale local solutions with global reach.', 'The collaboration is structured to leverage complementary capabilities. Silvania brings experience in carbon project development, environmental product markets, and advanced monitoring tools such as remote sensing. Alder Point will take the lead on acquisitions and day-to-day management of timberland assets, applying ecological forestry practices that balance productivity with biodiversity protection.', 'Eelco Hoekstra, CEO of Silvania, framed the deal as a practical step in linking finance with ecological outcomes. “We are proud to partner with Alder Point to advance innovative solutions in carbon markets and conservation finance in the US. This partnership reflects our commitment to scaling nature-based solutions that deliver measurable ecological, social, and financial impact while restoring the planet’s natural balance.”', 'For institutional investors, US timberland has long been valued for diversification and resilience. The new partnership aims to deepen that role by positioning timberland as a platform for nature-based revenue streams, including carbon credits, conservation finance, and regenerative land use.', 'Jessamine Fitzpatrick, Managing Director at Alder Point, said Silvania’sentry will accelerate impact at scale. “Silvania’s partnership and expertise will enable Alder Point to transform U.S. timberland properties into high-impact, income-generating assets that further objectives related to climate, biodiversity, and rural communities. Their leadership in nature-based solutions and environmental markets strengthens our initiatives to address ecological challenges and to support local communities in a private markets context.”', 'RELATED ARTICLE:Silvania, Conservation International, and TNC Launch $1.5 Billion Amazon Protection Fund at WEF Davos', 'The timing is significant. US regulators and global standard-setters are pressing for greater transparency in how natural capital is managed and financed. Biodiversity is increasingly seen as a systemic risk, and investors are under pressure to align portfolios with frameworks such as the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD).', 'Partnerships like Silvania and Alder Point’s respond to these pressures by linking capital flows to measurable environmental outcomes. Timberland assets, when managed under ecological forestry principles, can deliver carbon sequestration, habitat restoration, and rural employment, while still generating returns.', 'For C-suite executives and institutional allocators, the partnership signals growing momentum around private market strategies tied to conservation. Rather than siloing financial performance from ecological outcomes, the model positions both as mutually reinforcing.', 'The partnership also suggests a maturing of carbon and conservation finance in the US. By embedding biodiversity and rural development alongside timber yields, it expands the investable universe for funds seeking to address climate and nature loss simultaneously.', 'While this initiative is focused on US assets, the implications extend globally. Silvania’s platform seeks to create replicable models that can be adapted across regions where biodiversity and land management intersect with private finance. With pressure mounting on governments and investors to deliver credible nature-positive outcomes, cross-border partnerships that merge financial engineering with local expertise are likely to proliferate.', 'For ESG leaders, the Silvania–Alder Point collaboration highlights a central takeaway: nature-based solutions are moving from philanthropic side projects into mainstream investment strategies. The trajectory is no longer whether capital will flow into conservation finance, but how fast and under what governance frameworks it will scale.', 'FollowESG News on LinkedIn', 'First Name', '', 'Last Name', 'Email address:', '', 'Official logo of ESG News (C) 2025', 'About Us', 'Become a Contributor', 'Newsletter', 'Contact Us', 'Climate Week NYC 2025', 'Advertise With Us', 'Promote An Event', 'News Agency', 'Terms & Conditions', 'Privacy Policy', 'Cookies', 'Copyright']",https://esgnews.com/

Crane succeeds co-founder Scott Jacobs, who led the firm for more than a decade and shaped it into a leading player in the clean energy financing space.', 'The appointment brings one of the most seasoned executives in the energy sector back into the private arena, following Crane’s recent tenure as Under Secretary for Infrastructure at the U.S. Department of Energy. His move signals a significant step for Generate, which is preparing for a period of expansion and heightened competition in clean energy markets.', 'Richard Kauffman, former Chairman and current independent director of Generate, framed the transition as both continuity and change. “We are deeply grateful to Scott for more than a decade of visionary leadership that built Generate into a trusted partner in sustainable infrastructure,”he said. “The Board is excited to welcome David into the CEO role. His decision to dedicate the next phase of his career to Generate strengthens the firm’s ability to deliver value to investors while advancing the energy transition.”', 'Crane emphasized that his immediate focus will be on portfolio performance and scaling Generate’s lending operations. “Our core strengths—an operator’s mindset, strong balance sheet, capital flexibility, and deep market insight—are especially valuable in today’s environment,”he said. “In the near term, we will focus on maximizing value in our portfolio, investing in high-performing assets, and building our credit business.”', 'That strategy aligns with investor demand for stable, income-producing assets as renewable markets face inflationary pressures, supply chain constraints, and evolving regulation. By leaning into credit products, Generate aims to broaden its role as a financier while continuing to own and operate assets directly.', 'Crane’s career spans more than two decades across both corporate boardrooms and government agencies. He has served as CEO of five publicly traded energy companies, earning recognition as Energy Industry CEO of the Year byEnergyBizin 2010 and top energy sector CEO byInstitutional Investorin 2011.', 'His board roles have included JERA Co., Inc., Saudi Electric Company, ACWA Power, and Tata Steel. That global footprint provides Generate with direct access to networks spanning power generation, industrials, and international utilities.', 'Most recently, Crane oversaw critical infrastructure programs at the U.S. Department of Energy, including investments tied to the Biden administration’s climate and infrastructure agenda. His move back to the private sector may position Generate as a bridge between government-backed funding and private capital eager to enter clean energy markets.', 'RELATED ARTICLE:Generate Capital, CalSTRS\xa0Raises $1.5 billion for Sustainable Infrastructure Investments', 'For institutional investors, the appointment represents a signal of Generate’s intent to compete aggressively in the sustainable infrastructure space. The firm’s positioning—as both operator and capital provider—differentiates it from pure-play asset managers. That hybrid model has attracted pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and corporates seeking exposure to clean energy without taking on full operational risk.', 'Crane’s experience at the DOE could also help Generate navigate U.S. policy frameworks such as the Inflation Reduction Act, as well as cross-border financing structures increasingly relevant to global infrastructure investors. His global board track record adds a further layer of credibility for international partners looking to deploy capital into North America.', 'The leadership change comes at a pivotal moment for the energy transition. Rising interest rates have tightened financing conditions, while governments worldwide are pressing private capital to accelerate deployment of renewables, grid infrastructure, and low-carbon fuels.', 'Generate’s ability to expand its credit platform while maintaining operational control of assets could provide investors with a diversified approach to infrastructure exposure.

The transaction, backed by a syndicate of global and domestic banks, is the first borrowing base loan of its kind applied to the renewables sector in Australia.', 'The three-year revolving loan and Letter of Credit facility, denominated in Australian dollars, euros, and US dollars, provides Akaysha with both scale and flexibility to finance its pipeline of projects. BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, ING, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, and Westpac served as lead lenders.', 'Borrowing base structures are common in the US renewables and oil and gas industries but are new to the Australian energy transition. By linking loan capacity to the underlying value of operational and development-stage assets, Akaysha can increase the size of the facility as its portfolio grows.', 'Andrew Wegman, Chief Financial and Investment Officer of Akaysha Energy, described the facility as “a landmark for the Australian renewables sector,” adding that it would enable the company to “capitalise on the extensive set of near-term opportunities in Australian and global energy markets.”', 'He said the strong participation of leading banks demonstrated “confidence in both Akaysha’s strategy and the central role that large-scale batteries will play in ensuring a secure and sustainable energy transition.”', 'The financing follows operational delivery of Stage 1 of the Waratah Super Battery, now the world’s most powerful BESS. That project, designed to stabilize New South Wales’ grid and support greater penetration of renewables, underscores Akaysha’s ability to deliver large-scale assets at critical nodes of the energy system.', 'With multiple projects advancing in Australia, Japan, the United States, and Germany, the company is positioning itself as a cross-market player in the rapidly expanding storage segment. The International Energy Agency projects global battery storage capacity will need to multiply by more than sixfold this decade to integrate variable renewables and ensure grid stability.', 'RELATED ARTICLE:TotalEnergies Launches in Belgium Its Largest Battery Energy Storage Project in Europe', 'For C-suite leaders and investors, the significance lies in the facility’s structure as much as its scale. Borrowing base finance offers a replicable model for other developers seeking capital at portfolio level rather than asset-by-asset. This approach could lower transaction costs, shorten timelines, and attract larger pools of institutional capital into storage.', 'The backing by European, Japanese, and Australian banks also reflects intensifying competition among lenders to secure exposure to energy transition assets. For corporates and policymakers, it illustrates how financial innovation can accelerate deployment of enabling technologies at a pace aligned with decarbonization targets.', 'Australia, with its high share of variable renewables and ageing coal fleet, is one of the most critical testbeds for grid-scale storage. Success in financing and building projects at scale has implications well beyond national borders. If the borrowing base structure proves durable, it could set a precedent for financing storage pipelines across Asia-Pacific and Europe.', 'Akaysha’s facility shows how governance, finance, and technology are converging to meet the operational demands of a decarbonized grid.

Guest Post – The Water Reckoning: Why Water Stress is the Next Big Financial Risk,"['Environment/Guest Posts', 'ESG Today Guest PostSeptember 11, 2025', 'Many of us learned the basics of water stewardship early on – don’t leave the tap running, have a shower rather than a bath. Don’t waste what is essential. But somewhere along the path to industrial scale, that principle faded from view. In business, water isinvisible: easy to access, cheap to use and presumed to be secure.', 'With climate change, that illusion is breaking. Water stress conditions that were once considered rare such as extreme heat and groundwater depletion now occur with greater frequency. Supply is becoming less predictable while demand is accelerating.', 'In southern Europe, water shortages have forced restrictions on agriculture and disrupted industrial production. In parts of the United States and the Middle East, long-term drought has reduced hydropower capacity and stressed critical infrastructure. In the UK, infrastructure is showing signs of strain, even in regions previously considered stable.', 'With water intertwined into the delivery of everything from agriculture and manufacturing and energy generation to the internet, water stress is becoming a major business risk.', 'One of the main factors that has obscured water risk is that it is often underpriced. Many corporate systems record it as a utility cost, not as a variable that could materially disrupt operations rendering water risk invisible in standard budgeting, procurement and risk reviews.', 'Most organisations measure what they use directly. However, very few consider how much water is required to power their servers, process their inputs, or keep their suppliers operating. Even fewer understand what happens if that water changes in quality: if it arrives hotter, more saline, or more contaminated. Those changes can render systems inoperable, yet these factors – along with water availability, infrastructure fragility and climate-driven volatility – are not reflected in conventional risk models.', 'Nowhere is this blind spot more obvious than digital infrastructure. A single 1 MW data centre can use over 25 million litres of water annually, and as AI adoption accelerates, global water withdrawal for AI workloads is expected to reach 1.7 trillion gallons per annum by 2027 – more than four times Denmark’s annual consumption. Yet despite this trajectory, water remains largely absent in boardroom agendas – a risk that could quickly undermine the very systems driving future growth.', 'In some sectors, water stress is increasingly a gating factor in operational expansion. For example, data centre site selection increasingly accounts for water availability. Industrial planning must factor in drought risk and public opposition to water abstraction. Access to permits is becoming contingent on showing credible water management strategies. Investment decisions are being challenged by regulators and communities based on long-term water availability.', 'Those companies who continue to treat it as a secondary concern are likely to see its impact on their bottom line. Even if global temperature increases are limited to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, 31% of global GDP ($70 trillion) will be exposed to high water-stress. The business case for action is no longer hypothetical. It is a question of when water stress affects your operations,notif.', 'Even if water stress is not financially material to a business’ operations, there are reputational and regulatory risks associated with water stress. Disclosure expectations are shifting from general ESG statements to site-specific, model-backed risk data. Frameworks such as TNFD and SBTN are accelerating uptake of watershed-level assessment. Mandates from CSRD and CDP are pushing companies to demonstrate scenario resilience and transparent risk governance. These shifts are closing the gap between voluntary leadership and regulatory obligation.', 'Effective water risk assessment requires more than tracking consumption. It demands an understanding of two dimensions: physical exposure and operational vulnerability.', 'Exposure is shaped by geography and climate. It reflects where assets are located, how stressed those water systems are today, and how climate modelling suggests that will change over time. Vulnerability depends on the role water plays in an operation whether a site can continue without it, how infrastructure is configured, and whether alternatives or mitigation options exist.', 'This push towards digitalisation and AI adds a new layer of complexity. As more companies rush to integrate AI, many overlook how heavily water intensive their digital infrastructure has become. Without resilient water access and wastewater strategies, these assets can quickly turn into liabilities.', 'Traditional water metrics capture very little of this complexity. They measure volume but not dependency and are rarely sensitive to seasonality, contamination or infrastructure failure. However, newer tools such as satellite data, local modelling andscenario analysisnow allow companies to map these dynamics with far greater accuracy. These tools offer a level of insight that has not previously been available, although uptake has been slow.', 'Companies that struggle with water risk tend to repeat the same mistakes. They report usage in aggregate rather than location-specific terms. They treat water as a fixed input rather than a dynamic constraint. They assume continuity of access because it has never been interrupted before. They fail to assess the quality of what they draw, the resilience of the systems delivering it, or the competition for that same supply.', 'The gap between perception and reality is growing. The companies that catch up first will have more room to act. The ones that wait may have fewer options and higher costs.', 'For leaders seeking to strengthen organisational resilience, several steps can help translate awareness into action:', 'Water sits at the intersection of environmental risk and financial exposure. It affects operational continuity, long-term asset value, and the ability to grow in a resource-constrained world. For companies betting big on AI and digital platforms, this is no longer a climate issue but an infrastructure constraint which will determine where, and how fast, businesses can grow.', 'The cost of inaction is rising. In a world of constrained supply and rising expectations, leadership teams that embed water risk into core planning today will be far better positioned to navigate tomorrow’s shocks. In sustainability, we talk often about materiality. With water, the materiality is no longer in question. The only question is whether business leaders will respond: not just in policy, but in practice.', 'Because the world has changed.

The EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) takes effect at the end of this year, while U.S. forced labor laws and upcoming EU bans are expanding in both scope and enforcement. Alongside existing rules such as the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA), these measures are raising the bar for data quality, frequency, and coverage.', 'Companies are now accountable not just for their own operations, but for the practices of every supplier across their networks. To comply, they must be able to demonstrate, through auditable records, where their products come from, who produced them, and under what conditions.', 'In this environment, the ability to generate reliable, verifiable supply chain data will be the difference between market access and legal exposure.', 'Historically, supply chain reporting has relied on impact data – self-reported social and environmental impact metrics that demonstrate progress towards voluntary ESG goals and external reporting. While useful, this data rarely meets the threshold of regulatory demands.', 'Compliance data is different. It must be concrete, legally defensible, and specific. It requires verifiable documentation such as proof of origin, facility audits, and transaction-level records. Without this type of data, companies risk fines, lawsuits, blocked shipments, and loss of market access as well as scrutiny from regulators, investors, and the public.', 'Forward-looking organizations recognize that managing both types of data, and knowing how to apply them in the right context, is now a core responsibility of compliance and governance.', 'Supply chain risk has always included disruptions like raw material shortages, labor disputes, shipping delays, or facility shutdowns. But today, compliance failures represent one of the most consequential risks of all.', 'Failure to provide sufficient data can stop goods at the border, delay retail listings, or expose companies to penalties. Increasingly, climate litigation is also expanding beyond “greenwashing” claims to scrutinize how companies integrate climate considerations into their operations, and whether they can back those claims with verifiable data.', 'While traceability investments often begin defensively, their benefits extend far beyond risk avoidance. Companies that master compliance-grade data are better prepared for regulatory change, more resilient to legal and reputational threats, and more trusted by stakeholders.', 'To meet these expectations, companies are investing in digital traceability platforms capable of mapping multi-tier supplier networks, capturing documentation at scale, and linking compliance records directly to purchase orders. These tools bring much-needed visibility into areas of the supply chain that have historically been opaque and provide the audit trail regulators increasingly require.', 'The compliance landscape is evolving rapidly, and companies that wait to adapt will find themselves on the defensive. Those that act now to embed traceability into compliance strategy will not only meet regulations with confidence, but also strengthen resilience, reputation, and long-term growth.', 'For compliance leaders, the mandate is clear: supply chain traceability is no longer a nice-to-have. It is a foundation for governance, resilience, and competitive advantage.', '', 'ESG Tools, Services/', 'Guest Posts/', 'ESG Tools, Services/', 'Join our mailing list\xa0for the latest breaking ESG investment news!', '', '', '', 'LevelC-LevelSVP / EVPDirector / VPManager / SupervisorMid or Entry LevelFreelance / ContractStudent / InternRetiredOther', 'FunctionAccounting & FinanceBusiness Development & SalesCustomer SupportFacilitiesHR & TalentInvestingLegalMarketing & CommunicationsOperationsR & DProcurement & ContractingSupply Chain & DistributionSustainabilityStrategyTechnologyOther', '', 'Back to Top', 'Join\xa0the ESG Today daily newsletter and get all the top ESG stories, like this one.', 'Subscribe now below!', '', '', '', 'LevelC-LevelSVP / EVPDirector / VPManager / SupervisorMid or Entry LevelFreelance / ContractStudent / InternRetiredOther', 'FunctionAccounting & FinanceBusiness Development & SalesCustomer SupportFacilitiesHR & TalentInvestingLegalMarketing & CommunicationsOperationsProcurement & ContractingR & DStrategySupply Chain & DistributionSustainabilityTechnologyOther', '']",https://www.esgtoday.com/
Guest Post: Breathing Room for Better Reporting – How Businesses are Making Sustainable Progress Despite EU Delays,"['ESG Reporting/ESG Tools, Services/Guest Posts', 'ESG Today Guest PostSeptember 9, 2025', 'In recent years, climate action and sustainability surged to the top of the policy agenda across Europe. The EU led the charge with the Green Deal, the launch of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), and landmark rules like the EU Taxonomy – all aimed at redirecting the economy toward net zero and more sustainable, transparent business practices. In today’s more complex economic and political climate, some suggest that sustainability has slipped down the list of priorities. Rising costs and global competition have triggered a broader debate about how the green transition should happen.', 'This shift has been compounded by recent EU decisions aimed at softening or simplifying green regulations.\xa0Recent amends to the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) look to reduce reporting burdens and introduce scaled-back requirements for smaller businesses. While these moves don’t signal a pull back from climate ambition, they reflect a growing need to make regulation more proportionate and easier to implement.', 'In many cases, instead of laying the foundation for more effective impact, the proposed changes added uncertainty just as companies were preparing to act. This could derail businesses’ sustainability ambitions, especially as some important guidance that may have applied to a smaller number of businesses has been cut in the simplified ESRS draft, alongside entire subtopics, including waste discharge into the ocean.', 'Yet for some firms, the extra time created space to rethink their approach, paving the way for understanding sustainability not only as a compliance exercise, but embracing it to drive lasting value. That pause has helped shift the focus from short-term compliance to more structured, long-term preparation, laying the groundwork for stronger, more reliable reporting, and embedding sustainability in business operations.', 'In Sphera’s recent survey of nearly 400 EU business leaders, over half of respondents stated that they viewed the delays to reporting requirements as a chance to realign sustainability and supply chain goals. Rather than seeing the delay as a step back, many companies are using the time to strengthen data quality and better integrate environmental metrics into core operations.', 'This focus on long-term improvement is echoed by the 60% of surveyed leaders who said their top priority during the delay is to improve the quality of their sustainability data. Rather than treating reporting as a box-ticking exercise, this shift marks a move away from reactive compliance toward proactive sustainability management, setting the stage for more meaningful, integrated sustainability performance in the years ahead.', 'The delay in reporting requirements is also prompting companies to look beyond their own operations and deepen their understanding of supply chain sustainability. According to Sphera’s survey, 28%\xa0of businesses are using the extra time to invest in greater visibility beyond their tier 1 suppliers – a critical step given the rising expectations for value chain transparency under regulations like CSRD and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD). These companies recognise that meaningful sustainability reporting and risk management require insight into upstream activities, where many environmental and human rights impacts often occur.', 'More widely, 53%\xa0of respondents said they’ve already stepped-up efforts to manage supply chain risk through improved data. By strengthening the quality and reach of supply chain information, companies are not only preparing for more robust reporting but building resilience in the face of disruptions, from climate events to geopolitical shocks. This trend highlights that sustainability data\xa0has become\xa0crucial to operational and strategic risk management.', 'Despite this progress, we’re hearing from many companies that the absence of concrete guidance from Brussels is becoming a barrier to progress. While the extension has provided breathing room, businesses are increasingly frustrated by the lack of clarity around what’s next or open discussion about the current thresholds for companies to comply. EFRAG, the\xa0advisory body to the EU Commission which has developed the ESRS standards that set a framework for CSRD reporting, reduced the number of required disclosures by two-thirds in its July update.', 'Descoping 80%-94% of companies from the CSRD creates long-term risks for the European economy.\xa0The European\xa0Central\xa0Bank\xa0criticised this in amid-August statement, noting the importance that ESRS amendments ‘strike the right balance between retaining the benefits of sustainability reporting for the European economy and the financial system while ensuring that the requirements are proportionate’.\xa0The\xa0500-employee threshold, in turn, would bring 6,800 firms back into scope, with substantial cost savings resulting from freeing mid-sized firms from limited assurance.', 'Nearly half of firms surveyed by Sphera said they’re still unclear on how to move forward, which topics they needed to report on, and whether they would need to report at all. Without stronger, more consistent guidance, there’s a real risk that momentum will stall just as companies should be accelerating efforts – a tension that threatens Europe’s broader sustainability goals, and the bloc’s long-term competitiveness through sustainable business models.', 'Looking ahead, it’s clear that sustainability reporting is increasingly shaping how businesses operate from the inside out, as well as being a tool for meeting external expectations. Regulatory requirements such as CSRD are increasingly requested and used by investors and customers to make informed decisions. Consumers and investors want to see businesses build long-term value and resiliency regardless of regulations.\xa0This means companies embracing proactive, thorough sustainability reporting gain a\xa0competitive advantage.', 'These regulatory delays\xa0have offered companies space to elevate sustainability\xa0data as a strategic asset. This reflects a wider movement where companies are investing in building solid climate accounting structures, climate transition plans, amping up their supply chain sustainability efforts and sustainability strategy development and implementation. As reporting becomes embedded in core business functions, the organisations that succeed will be those that\xa0use this moment to lay the foundations for more resilient, strategically aligned operations.', '', 'Sphera is a software company specialising in sustainability and operational risk.', '', 'ESG Reporting/', 'ESG Tools, Services/', 'Guest Posts/', 'Join our mailing list\xa0for the latest breaking ESG investment news!', '', '', '', 'LevelC-LevelSVP / EVPDirector / VPManager / SupervisorMid or Entry LevelFreelance / ContractStudent / InternRetiredOther', 'FunctionAccounting & FinanceBusiness Development & SalesCustomer SupportFacilitiesHR & TalentInvestingLegalMarketing & CommunicationsOperationsR & DProcurement & ContractingSupply Chain & DistributionSustainabilityStrategyTechnologyOther', '', 'Back to Top', 'Join\xa0the ESG Today daily newsletter and get all the top ESG stories, like this one.', 'Subscribe now below!', '', '', '', 'LevelC-LevelSVP / EVPDirector / VPManager / SupervisorMid or Entry LevelFreelance / ContractStudent / InternRetiredOther', 'FunctionAccounting & FinanceBusiness Development & SalesCustomer SupportFacilitiesHR & TalentInvestingLegalMarketing & CommunicationsOperationsProcurement & ContractingR & DStrategySupply Chain & DistributionSustainabilityTechnologyOther', '']",https://www.esgtoday.com/
